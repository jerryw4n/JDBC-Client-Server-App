# Two-Tier Client-Server Application Project Overview
Developed a Java-based two-tier client-server application using MySQL and JDBC. The project involves creating a GUI front-end that allows different client users to execute SQL commands based on their permissions. A separate accountant-level application will query a transaction logging database.
